This is my first ever coding project that is independent from Uni.

If you can even call this coding, that is. Lol

I hope it is the first of many, as i am having a lot of fun learning web dev, even though it is supposedly a rapidly dying area within comp sci due to its over-saturation and the recent developments in gen ai. nevertheless, i believe it is still important for the time being as hiring web devs is fairly expensive, and generative ai has a low ceiling, meaning it stops becoming effective once the complexity of a project reaches a small threshold.
